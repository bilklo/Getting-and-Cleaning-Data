=========================================

Introduction
------------
This repository contains my work for the project getting and cleaning data course project.

In the repository you can find the file run_analysis.R that contains the implementation for the project. 
In order to run the file the following steps must be followed:

1. Extract UCI HAR Dataset
2. Set working directory the UCI HAR Dataset folder

The script will create a tidy table. It will extract the table to a text file with the name export.txt

The CodeBook.md file explains the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables.
